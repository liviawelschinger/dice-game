        <p class="p">The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he
            whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score. But:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets
                lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>A player looses score when rolling a 6 two times in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>A player looses score when rolling a 6 two times in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>When the two dices show the same number, the double of the result gets added to the ROUND score.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND
            score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn. The first player to reach the entered final score
            on GLOBAL score wins the game. When no final score is entered it is set to 100.</p>
